## [News, Sentiment and Trading](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4966869)

Coauthors: Luca Barbaglia and Sebastiano Manzan

**Abstract**: We conduct a sentence-level sentiment analysis on idiosyncratic firm news texts and study the texts from three dimensions: sentiment score, news variation, and news coverage. Evidence confirms the findings from literature that high sentiment motivates trading, while we further find that the impact is not linear that neutral sentiment has stronger impact compared to tail sentiments. Neutral sentiment creates more space for divergent expectations and different interpretations of information. We define news variations as standard deviations of sentence sentiments in an article and find that it has significant impact on stock market trading where it increases turnover and volatility. News coverage positively affects trading activities but negatively affects returns. We also find that the impacts from sentiment score, news variations and news coverage are stronger for small firms, while influences are weaker on large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of considering text structure, firm size, and neutral news in understanding the impacts of news.

## [Modeling Optimal Strategies in CDS Markets: The Role of Creditor-Issuer Dynamics and Market Condition](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4967908)

Coauthors: Suman Banerjee

**Abstract**: We develop a model to analyze the optimal strategies of creditors and CDS issuers. By establishing conditions that ensure the reservation price of creditors exceeds that of the issuers, we demonstrate the existence of a CDS market. The difference between these reservation prices, influenced by factors such as risk aversion and fundamental uncertainty, plays a crucial role in shaping CDS market dynamics. We find that the issuer’s reservation price increases with the size of their equity position in the reference-entity, and decreases with the diversity of the issuer’s credit-risk portfolio. These findings have implications for the optimal design of CDS markets.

## [Macroeconomic Uncertainty, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Firm Cultures]()

(draft available upon request)

Coauthors: Haozheng Wang

**Abstract**: We examine the impact of firm characteristics and cultures on corpo- rate social responsibility under macroeconomic uncertainty. Our results suggest that firms increase CSR disclosure transparency under high economic policy uncertainty, with disproportionate responses in different reporting categories. Cost of capital plays the impeding role, while analyst coverage, litigation risk, and dividend payout policy encourage firms to participate in CSR reporting. We highlight the importance of cor- porate cultures in CSR disclosures. Firms with good innovation and quality intend to engage more in CSR reporting, while under macroeconomic uncertainty, integrity, teamwork, respect and quality enhance firms’ capability, allowing firms to respond mildly via CSR reporting.
