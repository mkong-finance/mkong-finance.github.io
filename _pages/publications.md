## [News, Sentiment and Trading](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4966869)

Coauthors: Luca Barbaglia and Sebastiano Manzan

**Abstract**: We conduct a sentence-level sentiment analysis on idiosyncratic firm news texts and study the texts from three dimensions: sentiment score, news variation, and news coverage. Evidence confirms the findings from literature that high sentiment motivates trading, while we further find that the impact is not linear that neutral sentiment has stronger impact compared to tail sentiments. Neutral sentiment creates more space for divergent expectations and different interpretations of information. We define news variations as standard deviations of sentence sentiments in an article and find that it has significant impact on stock market trading where it increases turnover and volatility. News coverage positively affects trading activities but negatively affects returns. We also find that the impacts from sentiment score, news variations and news coverage are stronger for small firms, while influences are weaker on large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of considering text structure, firm size, and neutral news in understanding the impacts of news.

## [Macroeconomic Uncertainty, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Firm Cultures]()

(draft available upon request)

Coauthors: Haozheng Wang

**Abstract**: We examine the impact of firm characteristics and cultures on corpo- rate social responsibility under macroeconomic uncertainty. Our results suggest that firms increase CSR disclosure transparency under high economic policy uncertainty, with disproportionate responses in different reporting categories. Cost of capital plays the impeding role, while analyst coverage, litigation risk, and dividend payout policy encourage firms to participate in CSR reporting. We highlight the importance of cor- porate cultures in CSR disclosures. Firms with good innovation and quality intend to engage more in CSR reporting, while under macroeconomic uncertainty, integrity, teamwork, respect and quality enhance firmsâ€™ capability, allowing firms to respond mildly via CSR reporting.
