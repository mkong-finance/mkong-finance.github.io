## [News, Sentiment and Trading](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4966869)

Coauthors: Luca Barbaglia and Sebastiano Manzan

**Abstract**: We conduct a sentence-level sentiment analysis on idiosyncratic firm news texts and study the texts from three dimensions: sentiment score, news variation, and news coverage. Evidence confirms the findings from literature that high sentiment motivates trading, while we further find that the impact is not linear that neutral sentiment has stronger impact compared to tail sentiments. Neutral sentiment creates more space for divergent expectations and different interpretations of information. We define news variations as standard deviations of sentence sentiments in an article and find that it has significant impact on stock market trading where it increases turnover and volatility. News coverage positively affects trading activities but negatively affects returns. We also find that the impacts from sentiment score, news variations and news coverage are stronger for small firms, while influences are weaker on large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of considering text structure, firm size, and neutral news in understanding the impacts of news.

## [CSR Disclosure as Employee Governance: Mitigating Firm Risk during Economic Policy Uncertainty]()

(draft available upon request)

Coauthors: Haozheng Wang

**Abstract**: We examine whether firms use corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosure as an employee governance mechanism in response to economic policy uncertainty (EPU). Using a large panel of U.S. firms from 2005 to 2023, we find that firms increase CSR transparency and EPU related keywords during periods of heightened EPU. In return, CSR disclosure is associated with reduced firm idiosyncratic risk during periods of heightened economic uncertainty. We introduce a new mechanism linking EPU and CSR through employee governance by revealing a shift in disclosure emphasis from external, long-horizon topics toward employee-focused content under economic uncertainty. We also find that firms with stronger culture appear to be less reliant on CSR disclosure to manage uncertainty, consistent with a substitution relationship between top-down firm culture and CSR communication. The results are robust to alternative measures of CSR disclosure and policy uncertainty.
